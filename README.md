Twitch Chat Hue Controls

This project integrates Twitch chat interactions with Philips Hue smart lighting, allowing users to control their Hue lights based on Twitch chat commands and notifications. 
The bot listens to Twitch chat messages and channel point reward redemptions, changing light colors or reacting to specific commands in real-time. It supports various event types, including stream status changes and custom reward redemptions.

Features:

    Twitch Integration: Responds to Twitch chat commands and custom rewards.
    Philips Hue Control: Adjusts Hue light colors based on chat inputs and notifications.
